The Game
- Lights Out is a logic/puzzle game, played on a gird of individual lights, which can either be lit or unlit.
- The puzzle is won when when all of the lights are turned off.
- You can click on a cell to toggle that light — but it also toggles the light above it, to the left of it, to the right of it, and below it.
- Cells on an edge or in the corner won’t flip as many lights, since they are missing some neighbors.

Plan
- Before reading further, take a moment to think about how you would design this, component-wise.
- We’ll give you a component design further down, but thinking about the requirements and what components/state/props would be needed will help you learn the skills to design applications out of components.

    - 2d grid

        - theirs states are lit of unlit, binary true or false.
    - each grid cell toggle effects the cells above, right, below, and left around it. ⬆️➡️⬇️⬅️

    Components Hierarchy Plan:

    - App.js:
        - Serves as the top-level component to set everything up and render the next components.
        - Manages the overall state of the game.

    - Board.js:
        - A child component of `App.js`.
        - Represents the Lights Out game board.
        - Builds the grid, defines key-names, and feeds a `useState` hook callback function to toggle the light to the next components as props.
        - Renders multiple `Cell` components.

    - Cell.js:
        - A child component of `Board.js`.
        - Represents an individual light.
        - Receives its state (lit/unlit) and click event as props.
        - Maintains a `useState` hook with a boolean value (lit or unlit) and a `setState` function, likely named `toggle`.
        - In the `toggle` hook, it flips the value between lit and unlit.
        - Each cell may keep track of its neighboring cells.
        - Sends click events updates up the hierarchy to the `App` component to update the game state with the click event handler.
